# Welcome to world of Arithmetica
Arithmetica is developed to help students, professional or scientists to learn or prototype work related to applied mathemetics.

Following are the features:

* Full-featured implementation of mathematical data types including complex numbers' quaternion and various sizes of matrices and vectors.
* Support for most of the math functions for basic maths, linear algebra, rounding, comparision, log, exp, powering etc.
* Support single-precision and double-precision floating point types.
* Geometric data types and algorithms for 2D and 3D - distance and intersection methods, bounding volumes etc.
* Random number and noise generation with around 10 algorithms
* Strong-Typed collections for the library's data types.
* Support for Multi-Dimensional array in case 2D, 3D are not sufficient.

## How to use the library
1. Create a new .NET core or Windows console project.
2. Right-Click on the solution and select Managed NuGet References.
3. Search for "Arithmetica", select and install the latest version
4. Open the class file and import namespace "using Arithmetica" to start using the library and its functions.
